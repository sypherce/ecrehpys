# Ecrehpys

**Ecrehpys** is a Node.js-powered Twitch bot built specifically for my personal Twitch channel. It acts as both a chatbot and a real-time media controller, responding to chat events with custom sounds, video playback, and OpenAI-generated replies. It's designed to enrich stream interaction through automation, creativity, and modular extensibility.

> This is a personal project in **active beta** — purpose-built for my Twitch setup, but the architecture may be useful for others building their own bots or stream tooling.
